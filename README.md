Satisfactory World Saves


This repository is dedicated to the end state / milestones of the satisfactory private server that is run within the [Level Crush Community](https://discord.gg/kwgrVT2).

These saves are provided and tracked so that members who could not particpate, or want to continue the world can do so at their own pace 

Each world is uploaded based off update version, and then the world attempt. Below you will find a list of links to the main save for those world attempts but in the respective folders you can find all related save files for that world attempt.

* [World 1 - Update 7](https://github.com/LevelCrush/satisfactory/raw/main/Update7_World1/server/LevelCrush_Update7_World1.sav)
